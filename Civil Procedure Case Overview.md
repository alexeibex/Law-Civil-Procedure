## Personal Jurisdiction
|Topic|Case|Conclusion|
|--|--|--|
|PJ|Pennoyer v.Neff | Possible to obtain personal jurisdiction over ∆ by serving them in forum state | 
|PJ|Burnham v. Superior Court | “transient jurisdiction” is still a valid means of obtaining jurisdiction over an individual defendant, even if the defendant is in the state briefly or for reasons unrelated to the litigation. |
|PJ|World Wide Volkswagen v. Woodson | “the chattel [product] is NOT an agent for service of process” where ever buyer takes it, car driving through state does not = PJ |
|PJ|Hanson v. Deneckla | Purposeful availment is necessary when determining "minimum contacts" - unilateral contact not enough |
|PJ|Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz | PJ upheld because the ∆ had an on-going contractual relationship with a FL franchise, agreed FL law presides & regularly contacted FL franchise |
|PJ|International Shoe v. | 	Creates SPECIFIC JURISDICTION - Cause of actions and claim by π arises from ∆ specific minimum contacts within the jurisdiction where,"Arising from"… "this specific claim"…"in this specific jurisdiction" & Also creates, GENERAL JURSIDICTION: Continuous and consistent presence of ∆ within state covers any claim by π or Domicile for an individual or PPB for a corporation|
|PJ|McGee v. International Ins. Co. | Deliberate initiations by ∆ to "reach out" to π - insurer reached out to CA by sending an offer to reinsure to CA citizen |
|PJ|Asahi Metal Indus v. Superior Court of CA| In Asahi, the Court split on the question of whether the mere act of selling goods outside the forum state that will likely be imported into the forum state for resale suffices to support jurisdiction. |
|PJ|Shaffer v. Heitner|When the only contact the defendant has with the forum state is the location of property as defined by statute in the forum state, the forum lacks personal jurisdiction over the defendant unless the minimum contacts test of International Shoe is satisfied.| 
|PJ|J.McIntyre Mach v. Nicastro|A defendant's placing goods into the stream of commerce with the expectation that they will be purchased by consumers within the forum State may indicate purposeful availment. But that statement does not amend the general rule of personal jurisdiction. It merely observes that a defendant may in an appropriate case be subject to jurisdiction without entering the forum -- itself an unexceptional proposition -- as where manufacturers or distributors "seek to serve" a given State's market.|
|PJ|Abdouch v. Lopez| In these cases like Using the _Zippo_ test, the exercise of jurisdiction is determined by examining the level of interactivity and commercial nature of the exchange of information that occurs on the Web site.|

Reid v. San Pedro
Erie - the central command of Erie is basic. In diversity cases federal courts must apply the law that would be applied by the courts of the state in which they sit. They are not free to decide for themselves the “right” rule of consideration, the duty that a railroad owes to a trespasser, or the enforceability of exclusive contracts. Rather than create “general common law,” their job in a diversity case is to apply state common law. In those broad areas where the law is largely judge-made, such as contracts, torts, probate, and property, state law reigns supreme because “there can be no other law,”
