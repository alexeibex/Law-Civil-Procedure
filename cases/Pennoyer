Pennoyer v. Neff 
ISSUE:Can a state court exercise personal jurisdiction against a non-resident who was not personally served with process within the state but by publication in a newspaper?

RULE: Since the adoption of U.S. Const. amend. XIV, the validity of judgments against persons who have not been personally summoned or had notice of the proceeding may be directly questioned, and their enforcement in the State resisted, on the ground that proceedings in a court of justice to determine the personal rights and obligations of parties over whom that court has no jurisdiction do not constitute due process of law.

CONCLUSION:
The judgment from the underlying action was invalid since the plaintiff was a non-resident of the state in which the action was brought and was not personally served. The validity of judgments against persons who have not been personally summoned or had notice of the proceeding may be directly questioned, and their enforcement in the State resisted, on the ground that proceedings in a court of justice to determine the personal rights and obligations of parties over whom that court has no jurisdiction do not constitute due process of law.
