## Reid v. San Pedro, L. A. & S. L. R.r.
39 Utah 617, 118 P. 1009 (1911)
 
### RULE:
Utah Comp. Laws ยง 456 x 1 (1907) provides: Whenever a railroad company shall provide gates for private crossings for the convenience of the owner of the lands through which such railroad passes, an owner shall keep such gates closed at all times when not in actual use, and if such owner fails to keep such gates closed, and in consequence thereof his animal strays upon such railroad, and is killed or injured, such owner shall not be entitled to recover damages therefor.

### FACTS:
The landowner filed a complaint against a railroad company for the recovery of damages for the killing of certain cattle. The landowner alleged that the railroad company was negligent in maintaining a fence and in permitting a fence along its railroad to be open, and as a result, certain cattle were killed. The district court rendered judgment in favor of the landowner. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court of Utah.

### ISSUE:
Was the landowner entitled to damages?

### ANSWER:
Yes.

### CONCLUSION:
The court affirmed with respect to three of the four causes of action that the landowner was entitled to damages because ample evidence supported the verdict that those particular cattle were killed where the railroad was unable to have a gate. It did reverse in one cause of action because the evidence indicated that the cow killed in that location could have entered the right of way from either a broken down fence or an open gate. Under Utah Comp. Laws ยง 456 x 1 (1907), if the cow entered upon the right of way through an open gate, the railroad company could not be liable for the loss if there was no evidence of negligence on the part of a trainman at the time the cow was killed because it was the duty of the landowner to keep the gate closed. If the cow entered upon the right of way through the broken down fence, the railroad could have been liable. The court concluded that the verdict rendered on the first cause of action was not supported by the evidence.
