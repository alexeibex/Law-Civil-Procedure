## Tolan v. Cotton
134 S. Ct. 1861 (2014)
 
### RULE:
Courts have discretion to decide the order in which to engage the two prongs of the qualified immunity analysis. But under either prong, courts may not resolve genuine disputes of fact in favor of the party seeking summary judgment. This is not a rule specific to qualified immunity; it is simply an application of the more general rule that a judge’s function at summary judgment is not to weigh the evidence and determine the truth of the matter but to determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial. Summary judgment is appropriate only if the movant shows that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). In making that determination, a court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the opposing party. The U.S. Supreme Court qualified-immunity cases illustrate the importance of drawing inferences in favor of the nonmovant, even when a court decides only the clearly-established prong of the standard. In cases alleging unreasonable searches or seizures, courts should define the “clearly established” right at issue on the basis of the “specific context of the case.” Accordingly, courts must take care not to define a case’s “context” in a manner that imports genuinely disputed factual propositions.

### FACTS:
During the early morning hours, an officer fired three bullets at plaintiff who was mistakenly accused of exiting a stolen car. One of the bullets punctured plaintiff’s right lung. Plaintiff was unarmed on his parents’ front porch about 15 to 20 feet away from the officer. It appears that the plaintiff was shot after he reacted to the way the officer treated his mother. There were differing versions from the parties as to how the plaintiff reacted. In affirming the district court's grant of summary judgment to the officer, the Fifth Circuit reasoned that regardless of whether the officer used excessive force, he was entitled to qualified immunity because he did not violate any clearly established right.

### ISSUE:
Was summary judgment properly granted in lieu of the officer’s qualified immunity?

### ANSWER:
No.

### CONCLUSION:
In vacating the judgment of the Fifth Circuit, the Supreme Court held that the Fifth Circuit failed to view the evidence at summary judgment in the light most favorable to plaintiff with respect to the central facts of the case. By failing to credit evidence that contradicted some of its key factual conclusions, the Fifth Circuit improperly weighed the evidence and resolved disputed issues in favor of the moving party. The Fifth Circuit should have acknowledged and credited plaintiff’s evidence with regard to the lighting, his mother’s demeanor, whether he shouted words that were an overt threat, and his positioning during the shooting.
