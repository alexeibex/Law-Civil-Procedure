## Bias v. Advantage Int'l, Inc.
284 U.S. App. D.C. 391, 905 F.2d 1558 (1990)

### RULE:
The moving party in a motion for summary judgment always bears the initial responsibility of informing the district court of the basis for its motion and identifying those portions of the record which it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. Summary judgment is appropriate, no matter which party is the moving party, where a party fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial. Thus, the moving party must explain its reasons for concluding that the record does not reveal any genuine issues of material fact, and must make a showing supporting its claims insofar as those claims involve issues on which it will bear the burden at trial.

### FACTS:
Plaintiff estate of deceased basketball player filed an action against defendants, company advisor of the player and the particular representative to the player, for failure to obtain a life insurance policy on the player and failure to finalize a contract between the player and a company prior to the player's death. The United States District Court for the District of Columbia granted summary judgment to defendants. It held that the estate did not suffer any damage from defendants' alleged failure to obtain life insurance for the player. The district court also concluded that defendants could not be held liable for failing to produce a finished endorsement contract before the player's death because defendants had no independent reason to expedite the signing of the endorsement contract to the extent argued by the estate.

### ISSUE:
Was the trial courts decision proper?

### ANSWER:
Yes

### CONCLUSION:
The court held that the estate was not entitled to reach the jury merely on the supposition that the jury might not believe defendants' witnesses. Because the estate failed to do more than show that there was some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts, the district court properly concluded that there was no genuine issue of material fact as to the insurability of the player, a drug user. The court held that neither the language of the representation agreement between the player and defendants nor any other evidence could support a finding that defendants breached any duty to the player by failing to push to obtain a signed contract on the day of negotiations prior to the player's death.
